- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @YoThatsCrazy
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ...web development (front-end, UI/UX), React, Node JS, smart contract writing, Fintech, networks, and anything else that will help me get better along this journey.
          Learning doesn't stop!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS in my boot camp because I love the creating side of coding. I might dip into the world of Fintech and learn some languages there or along the lines of QA Engineer. I'm still trying to narrow it down but I'm enjoying the learning the basics.
